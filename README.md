## 💡 Course-wise Guide
📌 **Applied Programming (AP):**  
- Hands-on coding in **C++** to strengthen programming fundamentals.  
- Covers **data structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and their real-world applications.  
- Includes **algorithm analysis** — time & space complexity, Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega notations.  
- Focus on solving problems efficiently, with emphasis on **divide & conquer, greedy methods, and dynamic programming**.  
- Regular practice on platforms like **LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces** is highly recommended.  
- Past papers and assignments are useful for understanding expected exam patterns and strengthening concepts.  

📌 **Advanced AI (AAI):**  
- Covers both the **theoretical foundations** and **practical applications** of Artificial Intelligence.  
- Core topics include:  
  - **Informed and Uninformed Search Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, UCS, etc.)  
  - **Weak AI vs. Strong AI** — philosophy, limitations, and future directions  
  - **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning**  
  - **Game Playing & Decision Making**  
  - Advanced paradigms like **CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and Reinforcement Learning**  
- Hands-on coding with **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** to build real-world AI models.  
- Emphasis on **experimentation** — tweak hyperparameters, optimize architectures, and critically evaluate results rather than just running sample code.    

📌 **Mathematical Foundations of AI (MAI):**  
- Core for ML/DL — vectors, matrices, eigenvalues.  
- Practice with 3Blue1Brown and Khan Academy YouTube series.  

📌 **Research Methodology (RM):**  
- Learn how to read/write academic papers, research ethics, and methodology.  
- Build the habit of weekly paper reading.

## ⚠️ Mistakes I Made in My 1st Semester
- Procrastinating on assignments → deadlines hit hard in MS.  
- Relying too much on lecture slides instead of recommended books.  
- Not starting the semester project early enough.  
- Neglecting mathematical rigor in ML/DL courses.
